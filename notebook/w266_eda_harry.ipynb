ZITO\\'S BREAD STORY - DAY\\ntext: Several dozen loaves of golden Italian bread are standing on\\ntext: end in a shaft of morning sunlight. They are standing on end\\ntext: in bins. In the window, ZITO\\'S can be read in reverse.\\ntext: We leave the loaves and DRIFT DOWN TO a Progresso Products\\ntext: calendar, which hangs from the wall by a nail. The month is\\ntext: November. Various phone numbers and delivery dates have been\\ntext: penned in in a rough scrawl. Now WE GO TO a white formica\\ntext: counter, scuffed and pocked from long use. On the counter,\\ntext: in a rinsed out olive jar filled with water, are three fat\\ntext: red roses. The TITLE APPEARS IN BLACK SCRIPT AGAINST THE\\nscene_heading: WHITE BACKGROUND.\\nspeaker_heading: MOONSTRUCK\\ntext: Now WE FAINTLY HEAR THE VOICE of Zito himself, and a low\\ntext: TAPPING SOUND. SOME CREDITS ROLL.\\nspeaker_heading: ZITO\\'S VOICE\\ndialog: (barely discernable)\\ndialog: Three times they cancel the order\\ndialog: with me, and three times they come\\ndialog: back. Who they kidding? They cheap,\\ndialog: cheap, cheap. The other bread they\\ndialog: get is no good. They save pennies.\\ndialog: Everybody complain and they come\\ndialog: back. \"Zito, your bread is the best.\"\\ndialog: They\\'re like children stupid in school\\ndialog: who cannot learn. The water. It\\'s\\ndialog: the water. You buy bread in Hoboken,\\ndialog: you get Hoboken water. Hoboken water\\ndialog: is dry. Ask anybody who knows. Ask\\ndialog: your father. He knows.\\ntext: During Zito\\'s plaintive words, WE LEAVE the roses and MOVE\\ntext: DOWN the counter TO a calculator being tapped very efficiently\\ntext: with the eraser end of pencil. When the results appear, the\\ntext: pencil notes the figure in a threadbare old ledger.\\nscene_heading: NOW WE SEE ZITO\\ntext: He\\'s a middle-aged Italian man with a kind face. But it\\'s\\ntext: early in the day, and he\\'s already been working for hours,\\ntext: so he\\'s a little tired and disgruntled.\\nspeaker_heading: ZITO\\ndialog: You want me to make you some coffee?\\ntext: NOW WE SEE LORETTA FOR THE FIRST TIME\\ntext: She\\'s entering a few final figures in the ledger. LORETTA is\\ntext: Italian, 37. Her hair black, done in a dated style, is flecked\\ntext: with grey. She\\'s dressed in sensible but unfashionable clothes\\ntext: of a dark color.\\nspeaker_heading: LORETTA\\ndialog: What d\\'you know about coffee?

Next to the bread are two steaming\\ntext: mugs of coffee.

How am I going to do your\\ndialog: income tax?\\nspeaker_heading: CONTI\\'S VOICE\\ndialog: I am an artistic genius.\\ntext: The SHOT WIDENS and now we can see Al Conti and Loretta\\ntext: sitting at the desk having Zito\\'s buttered bread and mugs of\\ntext: coffee. Loretta\\'s got her calculator going and is entering\\ntext: figures in Al\\'s black, gold-lettered ledger.\\nspeaker_heading: LORETTA\\ndialog: If you\\'re an artistic genius, how\\ndialog: come you got butter on your tie?\\ntext: He looks down and sees the stain. He\\'s at a loss.\\nspeaker_heading: LORETTA\\ndialog: Give it here. I\\'ll give you this,\\ndialog: Al, you make good coffee.\\ntext: She downs her coffee, accepts the stained tie which Al has\\ntext: taken off, and slams the ledger shut.\\nscene_heading: INT. ROBERT\\'S DRY CLEANERS - DAY - MORE CREDITS ROLL\\ntext: We are looking at a wall of dry-cleaned clothes bags. They\\ntext: are hanging from an automated grid. As we watch, the wall\\ntext: starts to move off to the left. A gap appears where no clothes\\ntext: are hung. The gap creates visual frame. In the frame is\\ntext: ROBERT. He is operating the grid with a little stick shift.\\ntext: He stops it and takes down a garment. He leaves the frame,\\ntext: heading off to the counter. When he moves away, WE SEE that\\ntext: Loretta is behind him, working her calculator, entering in a\\ntext: ledger. She slams the ledger shut, waves goodbye, and goes.\\ntext: After beat she reappears, produces Conti\\'s tie, says something\\ntext: to Robert, who is out of view, leaves the tie, and\\nscene_heading: INT. BUTCHER SHOP - DAY\\ntext: WE SEE a cleaver whacking an oxtail into section.\\ntext: Now WE SEE Loretta, a few feet away, tabulating on a chopping\\ntext: block that is partially obscured by a row of hanging rabbits,\\ntext: unskinned.\\nscene_heading: INT. A FLORIST SHOP - DAY\\ntext: A long white box is being filled with red roses. We HEAR the\\nscene_heading: FLORIST\\'S VOICE.\\nspeaker_heading: FLORIST\\'S VOICE\\ndialog: Red roses. Very romantic. The man\\ndialog: who sends these knows what he\\'s doing.\\ntext: Now WE SEE Loretta tabulating and the Florist working on the\\ntext: box of roses.\\nspeaker_heading: LORETTA\\ndialog: The man who sends those spends a lot\\ndialog: of money on something that ends up\\ntext: in the garbage can.\\ntext: The Florist gives her a look and then smiles.\\nspeaker_heading: FLORIST\\ndialog: I\\'m glad everybody ain\\'t like you,\\ndialog: Loretta. I\\'d be outta business.\\nspeaker_heading: LORETTA\\ndialog: Without me, you\\'d be out of business.\\ndialog: I like flowers.\\ntext: She gives him a sudden, brief, blinding smile. It\\'s the first\\ndialog: time we\\'ve seen her smile. She has gold work around one of\\ntext: her two front teeth. The Florist grunts and hands her a red\\ntext: rose.

THE GRAND TICINO - NIGHT\\ntext: White tablecloths and dark green walls, a tiny bar up by the\\ntext: door. The WAITERS all look a little alike. That\\'s because\\ntext: they\\'re all related.

JOHNNY and Loretta sit at a table for two talking quietly.\\ntext: They have their menus and glasses of red wine. Mr. Johnny is\\ntext: Italian, around 42. His wavy salt-and pepper hair is\\ntext: impeccably combed back; but there is so much that it threatens\\ntext: to fall forward someday and engulf his face. He is wearing a\\ntext: pinky ring, a dark suit, a gold watch, and, on his face, a\\ntext: mustache and a look of incredible seriousness. Loretta is\\ntext: Italian, 37. Her black hair, done in a dated style, is flecked\\ntext: with grey. She is wearing a dark blouse, black skirt, and\\ntext: high heels. One of her teeth is framed with gold work.\\ntext: Mr. Johnny is really timid of life, an overgrown boy, who\\ndialog: hides these qualities behind a veil of dignity.\\ntext: Loretta is tough and efficient, loyal and watchful; she\\ntext: watches out for Mr. Johnny, and defends him against life.\\ntext: BOBO, an Old World Italian waiter, comes over to take their\\ndialog: order.\\nspeaker_heading: BOBO\\ndialog: Are you ready?\\nspeaker_heading: MR.

Bonnie wakes up upon hearing this startling news and\\ntext: gets very excited.\\nspeaker_heading: BONNIE\\ndialog: I\\'ve been wanting to do this for\\ndialog: three years! Let me show you some\\ndialog: magazines! You\\'ve got to get a\\ndialog: manicure! And your eyebrows! Sheila!\\ndialog: I\\'m gonna need help!\\ntext: SHEILA, another beautician, joins Bonnie, and they both get\\ntext: very excited and start showing Loretta and each other\\ntext: magazines. They argue merrily about what they should do,\\ntext: leaving Loretta far behind. A MANICURIST joins them, with\\ntext: her stuff and starts soaking Loretta\\'s nails.\\ntext: A MONTAGE FOLLOWS\\ntext: They\\'re plucking her eyebrows.\\ntext: They\\'re cutting and dying her hair.\\ntext: They\\'re painting her nails.\\nscene_heading: EXT. CINDERELLA BEAUTY SHOP-DAY\\ntext: Loretta comes out. Her hair is jet black and done in a much\\ntext: more stylish way. She looks great. She looks around as if\\ntext: she has committed a crime, and walks off quickly\\nscene_heading: EXT. A DOWDY DRESS SHOP - DAY\\ntext: Loretta looks in the windows, is dissatisfied, and walks on.\\nscene_heading: EXT. A BOLD DRESS SHOP - DAY\\ntext: A stylish dress shop called INSINUATION. Loretta looks in\\ntext: the window, is intimidated, and walks on. A moment passes.\\ntext: She reappears. Tentatively, she enters.\\nscene_heading: INT. INSINUATION - DAY\\ntext: Loretta approaches a young woman, MER, who works there. Mer\\ntext: is about thirty, trendily dressed, and French. Mer and Loretta\\ntext: greet and talk. Loretta makes vague gestures trying to convey\\ndialog: what she wants, but the truth is she doesn\\'t know what she\\ntext: wants. Mer takes the situation in hand.\\ntext: There follows a MONTAGE of Mer showing Loretta various\\ntext: dresses, some outlandish, some beautiful, some\\ntext: incomprehensible. Loretta tries on several of the dresses in\\ntext: a big triple mirror. Some horrify her, some frighten her\\ndialog: because they\\'re so sexy, one bores her. We don\\'t see the\\ntext: dress that she ultimately does buy.\\nscene_heading: EXT. INSINUATION - DUSK\\ntext: Loretta walks out with a big shopping bag. She walks away\\ntext: down the street.\\ntext: WE FOLLOW Loretta away down the street. She comes to a BRIDAL\\ntext: SHOP with a big bride dummy shown off in the window She stops\\ntext: and looks at the bride. She walks close to the window and\\ntext: stares in hard. Then she slowly backs up from the bride.\\ntext: Two NUNS are walking by. Loretta, backing up from the dummy,\\ntext: bumps into the Nuns. She\\'s flustered, makes a brief apology,\\ntext: and hurries away, casting a furtive last glance at the shop\\ndialog: window.\\nspeaker_heading: END OF MUSIC\\ntext: THE TRANSFORMATIONAL MUSIC COMES TO A CLOSE.\\nscene_heading: EXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - DUSK\\ntext: Night is falling. Loretta appears and enters the house.\\nscene_heading: INT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - THE FRONT HALL - NIGHT\\ntext: As Loretta enters she drops her bag and, as she takes off\\ntext: her coat, calls.\\nspeaker_heading: LORETTA\\ndialog: Ma! Grandpa! No? Okay.\\ntext: A SINGLE BARK is HEARD from the top of the stairs. She looks\\ndialog: up.\\ntext: A WOODEN ACCORDION GATE SEALS OFF THE TOP OF THE STAIRS\\ntext: Visible behind the gate are a couple of dogs.\\nscene_heading: INT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT\\ntext: Loretta goes through a door and into the kitchen. She opens\\ntext: the refrigerator and a cabinet, and makes herself a scotch\\ntext: on the rocks. She sips it and starts to HUM in an understated\\ntext: way. She takes her drink and wanders out of the kitchen.\\ntext: LORETTA WALKS INTO THE LIVING ROOM\\ntext: She walks to each lamp in the room and turns it on. There\\ntext: are many table and standing lamps throughout the room.\\ntext: LORETTA IS LIGHTING THE FIRE\\ntext: Which was already built in the fireplace. It catches on\\ntext: nicely. She puts her drink down and gets a big standing\\ntext: antique mirror on rollers from its place against the wall.\\ntext: She wheels it to a central place in the room. Satisfied, she\\ntext: picks up her drink again, leaves the room for a moment, and\\ntext: then returns with her shopping bag. She throws it on a chair.\\ntext: Then she goes to the stereo and looks through the albums.\\ntext: She selects one and puts it on.\\nspeaker_heading: MUSIC\\ntext: Loretta waltzes around in front of the mirror, flirting with\\ntext: herself in a very serious way. She starts to unbutton her\\ndialog: blouse.\\nscene_heading: EXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - NIGHT\\ntext: The moon is overhead as music continues to PLAY. The CAMERA\\ntext: SOARS UP CLOSE to the moon, until it completely FILLS THE\\ntext: FRAME with its magic. The moon dissolves into:\\nscene_heading: INT. THE CASTORINI LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\\ntext: CLOSE-UP of LORETTA\\'S FACE as she puts the final touches on\\ntext: her make-up. Music continues to PLAY. The CAMERA PULLS BACK.\\ntext: WE SEE her full figure. She has changed into her evening\\ntext: dress and put on her heels. She\\'s swaying to the music. The\\ntext: evening dress is sensational. She leans forward and kisses\\ndialog: the mirror.\\ntext: WE SEE THE LIPSTICK KISS ON THE MIRROR\\ntext: In the mirror, all around the kiss, is reflected the fire.\\nscene_heading: EXT. EAST RIVER NIGHT\\ntext: The moon is reflected in the water as WE SEE the dock of the\\ntext: night before. We can SEE Jersey lit up across the river.\\ntext: But then something starts to replace Jersey. It\\'s a huge\\ntext: white liner coming down the river now, all of her lights\\ntext: burning, heading back out to sea. FLASHBULBS go off along\\ntext: the deck. We watch the length of the great ship pass as the\\nspeaker_heading: MUSIC PLAYS\\nspeaker_heading: END OF MUSIC\\nscene_heading: EXT. LINCOLN CENTER PLAZA - NIGHT\\nscene_heading: LINCOLN CENTER - LORETTA\\'S POV\\ntext: CROWDS OF PEOPLE in beautiful clothes fill the plaza created\\ntext: by the three great buildings. A glorious fountain filled\\ntext: with lights forms the centerpiece. Behind the fountain, grand\\ntext: and splendidly lit, is the magical Metropolitan Opera House.\\ntext: Two huge Chagalls, one to the right and one to the left,\\ntext: inhabit the face of the building, filling it with marvelous\\ndialog: color.\\ntext: LORETTA COMES TO THE FOUNTAIN\\ntext: The fountain is quiet and dark now. Loretta is puzzled.\\ntext: She remembers that it was going. While she looks, it lights\\ntext: up. Then small jets of water begin to appear. Then larger\\ndialog: jets.\\ntext: Then with a roar the central shaft of water rises high, higher\\ntext: into the night sky. She follows the column of water with her\\ntext: eyes up into the sky. Right above the crest of the water,\\ntext: like a beanball on a seal\\'s nose, is the moon.\\ntext: FROM OVER LORETTA\\'S SHOULDER WE SEE THE RUSHING WATER\\ntext: Forming an opaque wall before her. Then the fountain, for\\ntext: its next piece of aquatic choreography, drops away to nothing\\ntext: quite suddenly. And there, facing Loretta, on the opposite\\ntext: side of the fountain, is Ronny.\\ntext: He\\'s looking incredibly handsome and dashing in a tuxedo and\\ntext: topcoat and, of course, gloves. He smiles slightly and raises\\ntext: a hand in greeting. Loretta, caught off guard, smiles\\ntext: brilliantly at him. Then she remembers her situation and\\ntext: starts to put on her usual serious expression. But the\\ntext: fountain has rushed up into the sky again, obscuring her\\ntext: attempt at composure from, Ronny.\\ntext: Ronny COMES INTO VIEW again, walking toward Loretta around\\ntext: the fountain\\'s perimeter. He comes close to her.\\nspeaker_heading: RONNY\\ndialog: Hi.\\nspeaker_heading: LORETTA\\ndialog: Hi.\\nspeaker_heading: RONNY\\ndialog: You look beautiful. Your hair...\\nspeaker_heading: LORETTA\\ndialog: I thought I\\'d try it.\\ndialog: (qrudgingly)\\ndialog: You look good.\\nspeaker_heading: RONNY\\ndialog: Thank you.\\ntext: He goes to kiss her. She takes a step back.\\nspeaker_heading: LORETTA\\ndialog: I said I\\'d go to the opera with you.\\ndialog: Nothing else.\\ntext: Ronny immediately relents, gently takes her arm, and they\\ntext: walk off in the direction of the opera house.\\ntext: ONE OF THE CHAGALL\\'S FROM IMMEDIATELY IN FRONT OF THE MET\\ntext: Ronny and Loretta looking up at it.\\nspeaker_heading: LORETTA\\ndialog: Who painted that?\\nspeaker_heading: RONNY\\ndialog: Marc Chagall. A Russian.\\nspeaker_heading: LORETTA\\ndialog: Kinda gaudy.\\nspeaker_heading: RONNY\\ndialog: He was having some fun. Yeah, well\\ntext: he\\'s dead.\\ndialog: (he smiles)\\ndialog: Come on, let\\'s go in.\\ntext: Ronny and Loretta join the crowd streaming into the building.\\nscene_heading: INT. THE OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT\\ntext: Ronny and Loretta enter, giving tickets to usher.\\nscene_heading: INT. OPERA HOUSE - COATCHECK - NIGHT\\ntext: Ronny and Loretta checking their coats. Ronny\\'s coat is\\ntext: already off, and he\\'s helping Loretta off with hers. He hands\\ntext: her coat to the CHECKER and pockets the check. Then he turns\\ntext: and sees Loretta in her dress for the first time.\\ntext: He\\'s stunned by her beauty. He\\'s at a loss. He mumbles.\\nspeaker_heading: RONNY\\ndialog: Thank you!\\nspeaker_heading: LORETTA\\ndialog: For what?\\nspeaker_heading: RONNY\\ndialog: I don\\'t know. For your hair. For\\ndialog: your beautiful dress. For... you\\ndialog: know, I feel like a man again. You\\ndialog: know I love the Opera. You know it\\'s\\ndialog: been a long time since I\\'ve been to\\ndialog: the Opera.\\ntext: His eyes are bright with tears. Loretta is touched and starts\\ntext: to put her hand out to him. But she stops herself.\\nspeaker_heading: LORETTA\\ndialog: So. Where are we sitting?\\nspeaker_heading: RONNY\\ndialog: Come on.\\ntext: He takes her arm. They pass under the great chandelier and\\ndialog: go into the house.\\nscene_heading: THE OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT\\ntext: THE CAMERA PICKS OUT A SERIES OF COUPLES\\ntext: The first couple is PEGGY and CLIVE, a very distinguished\\ntext: pair of silver-haired lovers dressed magnificently. They are\\ntext: in their seats, delighted to be where they are, holding hands.\\ntext: Next is the CELEBRITY COUPLE. Maybe Jackie O and her son,\\ntext: John. They are seated and people are looking at them.\\ntext: Next is Cosmo and Mona. Cosmo is helping Mona to sit down,\\ntext: something she could probably handle herself. He\\'s wearing\\ntext: good but old-fashioned suit. She is in a dress that makes\\ntext: her look like a big piece of hard candy.\\ntext: Next is Ronny and Loretta. They are sitting in the first row\\ndialog: of the First Circle; in other words, very good seats.\\ntext: They are holding their programs. Loretta opens her program.\\nscene_heading: THE OPEN PROGRAM - LORETTA\\'S POV\\ntext: The opera is LA BOHEME. But then the page fades away into\\ntext: the dark as the house lights go down.\\ntext: WE SEE RONNY AND LORETTA FROM BEHIND\\ntext: Ronny leans his head toward her and whispers.\\nspeaker_heading: RONNY\\ndialog: Here we go.\\ntext: As the lights come up in the orchestra pit. The CONDUCTOR\\ntext: takes his place. The AUDIENCE APPLAUDS. He bows and turns to\\ntext: the orchestra. The OVERTURE begins and PLAYS UNDER NEXT.\\nscene_heading: EXT. THE GRAND TICINO - NIGHT\\ntext: The OVERTURE PLAYS THROUGH this ESTABLISHING SHOT and then\\ntext: FADES AWAY at the start of the NEXT SHOT. WE SEE Rose enter\\ndialog: the restaurant.\\nscene_heading: INT. THE GRAND TICINO - NIGHT\\ntext: The dinner crowd is in and most of the tables are occupied.\\ntext: The entranceway door opens and Rose enters.\\ntext: She\\'s got herself up very nice. The host, JIMMY, quickly\\ntext: approaches her. She\\'s very dignified.\\nspeaker_heading: JIMMY\\ndialog: Hello, Mrs. Castorini. Who\\'s coming?\\nspeaker_heading: ROSE\\ndialog: It\\'s just me. I want to eat.\\nspeaker_heading: JIMMY\\ndialog: Okay.\\nspeaker_heading: JIMMY\\ndialog: I got a table for you right now.\\ntext: Jimmy leads her to a table for two against the wall.\\nspeaker_heading: JIMMY\\ndialog: This alright?\\nspeaker_heading: ROSE\\ndialog: Fine.\\ntext: He seats her.\\nspeaker_heading: JIMMY\\ndialog: Enjoy your meal.\\ntext: Jimmy breezes off. There\\'s another table-for-two against the\\ntext: wall to Rose\\'s front. WE SEE a woman\\'s back from Rose\\'s POV,\\ntext: and a pretty head of hair. This woman, whose name is SHEILA,\\ntext: is having an argument with the man across from her.\\ntext: But the man\\'s face is blocked by Sheila\\'s back and head, and\\ntext: the argument is too low to be made out. Bobo approaches Rose\\'s\\ndialog: table.\\nspeaker_heading: BOBO\\ndialog: Good evening Mrs. Castorini. You\\ndialog: eating alone tonight?\\nspeaker_heading: ROSE\\ndialog: Hello, Bobo. Yes. Let me have a\\ntext: martini, no ice and two olives.\\nspeaker_heading: BOBO\\ndialog: Very good.\\ntext: Bobo heads off for the bar. The couple at the next table\\ntext: catches Rose\\'s attention again, and their argument becomes a\\ntext: little louder.\\nspeaker_heading: SHEILA\\'S VOICE\\ndialog: I\\'m trying to explain to you how I\\ndialog: feel. Every time I try to explain\\ndialog: how I feel, you explain how you feel.\\ndialog: I don\\'t think that\\'s really much of\\ntext: a response.\\nspeaker_heading: UNSEEN MAN\\'S VOICE\\ndialog: Well, its the only response I\\'ve\\ndialog: got.\\ntext: Bobo reappears with the martini and serves it.\\nspeaker_heading: BOBO\\ndialog: You wanna see a menu?\\nspeaker_heading: ROSE\\ndialog: Not yet. I\\'ll wave.\\ntext: Bobo is gone. Rose is mildly intrigued with the argument at\\ntext: the next table now. She tries to see past Sheila, to see the\\ndialog: man, but she can\\'t without making too big a move. The argument\\ntext: goes on.\\nspeaker_heading: SHEILA\\'S VOICE\\ndialog: I really do hate it though, when you\\ndialog: take that tone with me. Like you\\'re\\ndialog: above it all and isn\\'t it amusing.\\nspeaker_heading: MAN\\'S VOICE\\ndialog: But it is, isn\\'t it?\\nspeaker_heading: SHEILA\\'S VOICE\\ndialog: Not to me! This is my life, no matter\\ndialog: how damned comical it may seem to\\ndialog: you. I don\\'t need some man standing\\ntext: above the struggle while I roll around\\ndialog: in the mud!\\nspeaker_heading: MAN\\'S VOICE\\ndialog: I think you like the mud and I don\\'t.\\ndialog: That\\'s fair, isn\\'t it? If I don\\'t\\ndialog: care to...\\ntext: Sheila stands up abruptly and flings a glass of water in the\\ntext: man\\'s face. She pulls her coat off the back of her chair and\\ntext: stalks off. This whole operation took about two seconds.\\ntext: When she stalks off, the face of the man becomes visible to\\ntext: Rose for the first time. It\\'s Perry, the professor in his\\ndialog: 50\\'s, who appeared and was treated in a similar way in the\\ntext: earlier scene in this restaurant. His face is covered with\\ntext: beads of water. He pats his face with his napkin and\\ntext: apologizes to CUSTOMERS at neighboring tables.\\nspeaker_heading: PERRY\\ndialog: Sorry about that, folks. She\\'s a\\ndialog: very pretty mental patient.\\ntext: The Shy Waiter arrives to assist Perry in drying himself.\\nspeaker_heading: PERRY\\ndialog: Don\\'t mind about me. But could you\\ndialog: do me a favor and clear her place\\ndialog: and take away all evidence of her,\\ndialog: and bring me a big glass of vodka?\\nspeaker_heading: SHY WAITER\\ndialog: Absolutely!\\ntext: The Shy Waiter heads for the bar. For the first time, Perry\\ntext: notices Rose.\\ntext: They are facing each other with no obstacles in the way now.\\nspeaker_heading: PERRY\\ndialog: I\\'m sorry if we disturbed you.\\nspeaker_heading: ROSE\\ndialog: I\\'m not disturbed.

That was rude.\\nspeaker_heading: ROSE\\ndialog: Will you join me for dinner?\\nspeaker_heading: PERRY\\ndialog: Are you sure?\\ntext: She nods.\\nspeaker_heading: PERRY\\ndialog: Then I\\'d be delighted.

What do you do?\\nspeaker_heading: ROSE\\ndialog: I\\'m a housewife.\\nspeaker_heading: PERRY\\ndialog: Then why are you eating alone?\\nspeaker_heading: ROSE\\ndialog: I\\'m not eating alone. Can I ask you\\ndialog: a question?\\nspeaker_heading: PERRY\\ndialog: Go ahead.\\nspeaker_heading: ROSE\\ndialog: Why do men chase women?\\nspeaker_heading: PERRY\\ndialog: (considers)\\ndialog: Nerves.\\nspeaker_heading: ROSE\\ndialog: I think it\\'s because they fear death.\\nspeaker_heading: PERRY\\ndialog: Maybe. Listen. You wanna know why I\\ndialog: chase women? I find women charming.\\nspeaker_heading: PERRY\\ndialog: I teach these classes I\\'ve taught\\ndialog: for a million years. The spontaneity\\ndialog: went out of it for me a long time\\ndialog: ago. I started off, I was excited\\ndialog: about something and I wanted to share\\ndialog: it. Now it\\'s rote, it\\'s the\\ndialog: multiplication table. Except\\ndialog: sometimes. Sometimes I\\'m droning\\ntext: along and I look up, and there\\'s\\ndialog: this fresh young beautiful face, and\\ndialog: it\\'s all new to her and I\\'m this\\ndialog: great guy who\\'s just brilliant and\\ndialog: thinks out loud. And when that\\ndialog: happens, when I look out among those\\ntext: chairs and look at a young woman\\'s\\ntext: face, and see me there in her eyes,\\ndialog: me the way I always wanted to be and\\ndialog: maybe once was, then I ask her out\\ndialog: on a date. It doesn\\'t last. It can\\ndialog: go for a few weeks or a couple of\\ndialog: precious months, but then she catches\\ndialog: on that I\\'m just a burnt out old\\ndialog: gasbag and that she\\'s as fresh and\\ntext: bright and full of promise as\\ntext: moonlight in a martini. And at that\\ntext: moment, she stands up and throws a\\ndialog: glass of water in my face, or some\\ndialog: action to that effect.\\nspeaker_heading: ROSE\\ndialog: What you don\\'t know about women is a\\ndialog: lot.\\nscene_heading: INT.

Listen,\\ndialog: Johnny, there\\'s a question I want to\\ndialog: ask you. And I want you to tell me\\ndialog: the truth if you can. Why do men\\ndialog: chase women?\\nspeaker_heading: MR.

When God took the rib, he left\\ndialog: a hole there, place where there used\\ndialog: to be something. and the women have\\ndialog: that. Maybe a man isn\\'t complete as\\ntext: a man without a woman.\\nspeaker_heading: ROSE\\ndialog: But why would a man need more than\\ndialog: one woman?\\nspeaker_heading: MR.

SINGS as much of it as he\\ndialog: remembers, which is a lot.\\ntext: WE WATCH RONNY WALKING FROM THE BACK NOW\\ntext: He\\'s SINGING away, carelessly sauntering along.

They start to SING along with him.\\ntext: They SING till they get to the ceiling of the aria, and to a\\ntext: resting place a little beyond.

Rose puts a bowl of oatmeal in front of\\ntext: him. He absently begins to eat it. A silence reigns. Then he\\ntext: puls down his spoon.\\nspeaker_heading: COSMO\\ndialog: You\\'re Johnny\\'s brother?\\nspeaker_heading: RONNY\\ndialog: Yeah.\\ntext: Cosmo picks up his spoon and they all eat silently once more.\\ntext: The SOUND OF DOGS BARKING comes up and then fades away.\\ntext: THE OLD MAN WALKS IN\\ntext: He looks at the assemblage.

The Old are not wanted.\\ndialog: And what they say has no weight.\\ndialog: But, my son, I must speak. You should\\ndialog: pay for the wedding of your only\\ndialog: daughter.

If she gets married,\\ndialog: I\\'ll pay for the whole thing.\\ntext: The Old Man lets go a great noise of relief, sits down at\\ntext: the table, and waits. Rose brings him a bowl of oatmeal.\\ntext: He is content now, and eats his oatmeal with great relish.\\ntext: The others eat with a more meaningful silence. Rose puts\\ntext: down her spoon.

A tremendous silence falls. An old\\ntext: clock goes tick, tick, tick. Suddenly Cosmo smashes his fists\\ntext: to the table and stands. He doesn\\'t look at Rose during this.\\ntext: Then slowly, he sits down.\\nspeaker_heading: COSMO\\ndialog: Okay.\\nspeaker_heading: ROSE\\ndialog: And go to confession.\\nspeaker_heading: COSMO\\ndialog: (still not looking at\\ndialog: her)\\ndialog: A man... under stands one day...\\ntext: that his life is built on nothing.\\ndialog: And that\\'s a bad, crazy day.\\nspeaker_heading: ROSE\\ndialog: Your life is not built on nothing.\\ndialog: Ti amo.\\ntext: She puts her hand across the table to him.\\nspeaker_heading: COSMO\\ndialog: Ti amo.\\ntext: He slides his hand out and takes her hand.
