We get a brief description of the scene: \"What a beautiful Fucking Day\" . A guy named Aidan Mcbride has just arrived from Ireland. He looks like he\\'s just had a hard time getting out of the city. He\\'s got a drink in his hand, and he wants to go back home before Mammy tells him what happened.', 'Batman Year One': \"In this short scene, Frank Miller shows up at the auto shop looking for his son. He's a little confused about where he's going and what he can do there. When he gets there, he sees that the job orders are in order and he asks Bruce to come out and help him out since he looks so bad. Bruce tells him it's all fine and then he goes off to check on some other things.\", 'Inherent Vice': \"Paul Thomas Anderson's reminiscing about how much he used to love Shasta. Now that he has an office and everything, he decides it's time to take a walk. He looks in his phone book and thinks about how great it would be if everyone had this opportunity to get out of bed and have a little chat with one of his old co-workers. Then he goes over to the office\", 'Colombiana': 'The narrator tells us that the story is about a young boy named Fabio who wants to become a doctor, a lawyer, and a friend of Don Luis\\'s. It\\'s been a long time since we last saw him in his comic form, but now he\\'s back on his own. He asks her what she\\'s doing with her life, and she responds by telling him it\\'s \"studying mama\" . She also tells him that if he doesn\\'t want to be anything in life, he has to study for it. This is like being a super-hero or a Doctor. We learn that Emilio is supposed to come see them someday, but they haven\\'t heard from him yet.', 'Barney s Version': 'In this short scene, Barney is trying to get his wife to talk to him. He wants to know what she wants him to do with the photographs he has taken of Rosalind. His dad isn\\'t there and he\\'s late. He tells his wife that it\\'s three o\\'clock in the morning and that he wants her to call him on the phone so he can ask her about them. She doesn\\'t want to hear anything but \"Barney.\"', 'Zootopia': \"The narrator takes us back to the time when bloodlust was the force that ruled the world. Prey and prey were afraid of predators, but over time, they moved beyond their primitivism and lived in harmony. He tells us that he's going to be an astronaut, a police officer, and a Bunny Cop. That's right, this is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.\", 'Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark': 'The narrator tells us that some towns have \"a curse\" and that one of them is Mill Valley. Which one is which? It\\'s the season of the witch. We get another brief scene in which Del Toro gives us a tour of his house and then goes on to tell us about how he just got back from New York after meeting with Senator Rusk. He says he had a good briefing, and then went off to go watch the sun go down.', 'The Edge of Seventeen': 'January 3, 2011 Fremon Craig calls on Kelly and tells her that he\\'s been \"chucking everything\" she\\'s ever given him in the Norfolk Pond. Oh, and also, all of their pictures from Canada. He says he doesn\\'t want to repeat himself because he thinks he has a lot of \"addendous\" things to say. So he sends her a message telling her to leave a note and not to reply until he hears from her again.', 'As Above So Below': \"In this short scene, Dowdle tells us that he's about 20 miles outside of the Habala region and is worried about what might happen to his family if he were found dead. He wants to know if they can find him alive so they can take him back to their caves. They have to hurry because they don't want to risk everything going wrong. So they decide to head out without him. Nope.\", 'Celeste Jesse Forever': 'In this short scene, Will and Rashida discuss their love for each other. They say that they\\'re still best friends, and that they have a lot of things in common. Jesse asks him to turn the phone down because he\\'s running an ersrand with Jesse. He tells Jessie to turn it down so he won\\'t have to run through town looking for a newspaper. Then he says something like, \"OK, fine, I\\'ll give you a quick bit of information about New York Times.\"', 'Up in the Air': \"In this short lesson, the narrator explains how much one person's life weighs and how to pack it into a small, light-filled bag. He then instructs the audience to imagine that they are carrying a large, heavy backpack filled with everything they own in their life. They should start by putting away the little things first, like clothes, furniture, and linens. The more stuff they have, the heavier they will carry.\", 'Newton': 'In this short scene, the dialogue shifts to the political situation in India. The narrator muses on the futility of electing a Bhaer from among the castes. He wonders aloud whether the Indian people will vote for him in the forthcoming elections. When the audience realizes that the candidate is none other than the ex-President of India, it becomes obvious that the two men do not approve of each other.', 'Mark Felt The Man Who Brought Down the White House': 'In this short scene, Richard Nixon is reelected as President of the United States. He sits at a table in front of a group of black men and tells them that he doesn\\'t want to arrest anyone because \"Goddamn Russian revolution out there.\" The men know that Hoover is running the F.B. office, but they don\\'t have enough money to pay for it. They wonder aloud whether the president wants to be an F.C. man like Hoover.', 'Alice in Wonderland': \"The narrator tells us that Alice has lost all of her senses and is now ready to embark on a new adventure. In this short scene, we get a brief description of the sights and sounds of the world outside of Alice's window: birds, cats, and a blue-eyed rabbit. We learn that these creatures are only dreaming, and that they can be woken up in the morning by anyone who is willing to believe them.\", 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes': \"The narrator tells us that it's been four weeks since they started the therapy. They've seen new cell growth, and they're starting to see more of it in the frontal part of the body. It looks like there's still some kind of scarlet on the side of the brain. But we don't yet know exactly where this is coming from--we're not sure yet. In other words, things are looking pretty good.\", 'Jennifer s Body': 'In this chapter, the narrator tells us that every day he gets letters from people who are praying for him. They say things like \"I\\'m sorry you did it\" or \"I just don\\'t want to do it anymore.\" Nobody ever comes back. People ask him if he\\'s sorry he did it and he says he is. And then there\\'s the mental gymnastic thing. It\\'s supposed to help us vent our angers.', 'MacGruber': \"In this short scene, the action shifts to the Russian camp at Eagle's Nest. Wombat has lost his position and is unable to retrieve the key that was given to him by Colonel James Faith. The lieutenant asks why they had to travel so far to get this information. He says they need someone outside of the system to keep an eye on the man, but it would be impossible for them to keep him inside the system.\", 'Good Vibrations': 'In this short scene, Colin Carberry explains that his father is a socialist who has just returned from the war in Vietnam and is planning to become blinded. The crowd gathers to hear what they call a revolutionary speech. They are all confused by the common people of Jamaica and Belfast who have been oppressed by the English and American colonists since the time of the Confederacy. This makes them wonder if their country has any real potential for revolution.', 'Frances Ha': 'In this short scene, Gerwig and Noah Baumbach engage in a series of dialogues. They are interrupted by the arrival of Greta, who is carrying a bag full of money. She asks them to take off their socks so that she can watch the entire movie while she is on stage. After they exit, she discovers that it is her hairless hair that is beside her bedchamber. As she watches, she realizes that there is thievery in the bag.', 'Black Panther': \"In this chapter, Joe tells his son the story of home. It's about a time when humans came to Africa and five tribes called the Wakandans. They lived together until a vision came from the god Bast, who led them to the Heart-Shaped Herb plant, which gave them superhuman strength and speed. The first Black Panther was the leader of the tribe, but four tribes agreed that they would live under the king's rule. The Jabari were isolated in the mountains because they didn't want to be seen.\", 'Y The Last Man': \"The narrator tells us that the men are responsible for the deaths of three of the soldiers. It turns out that they're all brothers, and one of them was born just before giving birth to the king. In other words, there's no way anyone could have given birth to a twin at this point in the play. So we guess it's not coincidence that the two boys were twins when they were born.\", 'Shadow Dancer': 'In this short scene, Hoskins and Lucas are loading up the cannons to shoot down a drunken boy named Sean. When they finally find out who the kid is, they freak out because no one answers their pleas for help. Instead, they\\'re all \"I don\\'t want to see you killed\" . They run off to get some food when they hear that the man has been shot in the foot. We interrupt this program to tell you that it\\'s pretty clear that there\\'s something going on between these two guys.', 'Secretariat': \"In this short scene, Randall Wallace rehearses his lines for the Christmas Pageant. He tells us that he's going to buy a gown for the party and then go shopping at the wine shop to pick up some more. When he gets home, he complains about how much he hasn't bought yet. Then he goes on to talk about what a Christmas pageant it will be.\", 'Dunkirk': \"One week later, the ship is being repaired. Four men are stationed at each corner of the ship to take care of the repairs. The Navy wants to return in an hour's time. Captain Donnithorne tells everyone to keep an eye on the gauge--even when it gets very busy--to make sure that everything runs smoothly. He also warns everyone about taking their own weapons with them when the ship gets back.\", 'Hold the Dark': 'The narrator and his assistant, Kelly, are sitting outside in the cold. They\\'re trying to figure out how to make a movie about snow and ice. When they hear that it\\'s going to be a dark, rainy night, they run into each other. We interrupt this program for a little bit to let you know that there\\'s some serious drama going on between the two of them. It turns out that both of them have hired \"advertent associates,\" which is a term for people who don\\'t yet have enough money to pay for their own productions. In other words, we\\'re not exactly sure what kind of person they\\'re supposed to be working for.', 'Bridget Jones s Baby': 'On January 8, 2016, at the Universal Studios, Helen and Dan are gathered to mourn the death of their friend and neighbor, Daniel Vincyn Cleavesver. They also remember his wife, who is pretty. Emma invites everyone in the audience to share some memories of their own childhood friends and family members who loved and cared for Daniel. As they do so, Emma whispers to Jude that she would like to hold a party to remember them all.', 'Dirty Girl': 'The narrator tells us that every girl is born with a reputation, and that some girls are \"sweet\" and dreaming of books, while others are \"hunchesbacks.\" Some girls fall between houses, live windows, and become dirty. He says that the best girls are born dirty because they\\'re born dirty. When he asks who can give him an example of this kind of choice, he gets a pretty good one: Waiting. If a guy truly likes you but doesn\\'t know how to understand, then he knows so much about it. What\\'s more, if you don\\'t stick around long enough, you might end up like his mom knows.', 'This Is the End': 'In this short scene, the narrator prepares to tell us what\\'s going on in Los Angeles. He\\'s just finished watching \"The Book of Revelations\" and is super bummed about not being able to watch it yet. It\\'s been a while since we last saw him in Act 2, so let\\'s check back in a bit. We learn that Seth is now in town for an acting gig, and he\\'s got a crush on Scarbble The Movie.', 'Ryan Hansen Solves Crimes on Television': 'In this very brief scene, Thurber tells us that he\\'s been watching the entire \"Jane Dinah\" thing on stolen Chinese net and that it\\'s pretty much killing him. He even praises Jessica Mathers for making him so good at running around town like a madman. But he doesn\\'t want to go into his head about how great the show is or what people are saying about it. He just wants to find his center and keep going.', 'Pacific Rim': 'The narrator introduces us to some of the more common terms used in this chapter. For example, \"brain-To-brain Interface\" refers to a type of vision shared by two gunners -- Jaeger and Borachio -- without the use of a nerve interfering with it. This kind of vision is sometimes referred to as \"ghost-drift.\" It\\'s also used to describe a sort of telepathy that happens when someone has a hard physical proximity to another person or something.'}\n"

When people come by, they stop and shout \"Cutter to Frances\" and Sophie runs through the park with her. They make sure to keep one of their cases so that they can go into the subway together. After dinner, Frances reads aloud a sentence from Sincerity and Accurity by Philippe Lionel Trolling. She smokes in two separate windows.', 'Black Panther': \"In this short scene, a meteorite strikes Africa and changes the landscape. The five tribes of Africa unite and eventually break apart as war breaks out. A man named N'jobu shoots at a gun and goes over to the border. As the light from the sky approaches, kids play pick-up basketball in the background. An African guy named Nejobu sorting through firearms goes over toward the edge of the earth.\", 'Y The Last Man': 'The action shifts to a small, speeding van that is being driven by a young man who has just died. His mother is screaming in the front of the van and two other boys are slumped on the passenger seats. Outside, there are many crashes taking place. Most of the cars contain the corpses of recently deceased men. Some of the drivers are also killed. There are some minor flaws in the landscape as well.', 'Shadow Dancer': \"The narrator tells us that this is the first time we've heard of a twelve-year old girl named Collett. She's making a bracelet out of beads and listening to 10c's hit single rubber bullets on the cellophone. Her father, Gerry Senior, stands around the door and stares at her while she makes a necklace. He interrupts a call with his hand over one of the bullets and disappears once again. When she walks through the door, she sees her brother, Sam, eating a breakfast of cereal. As he gets closer to the shop, he hears rioting going on in the other part of the city.\", 'Secretariat': \"In the late 1960's, Penney Cheerney Tweedy lives in a manicured neighborhood with a paperboy who reads the morning edition on her porch. She is perfectly dressed and checks her watch before going to work. She wakes up early and opens the door to the front door. She lifts the newspaper from the porch and pulls it down to a table set for breakfast. Penny makes Jack a omelet and they sit down together to make pancakes. Sarah is 18 and Kate is 16 and both girls are kissing.\", 'Dunkirk': 'The action shifts to a desolate street in London. Six \"filthy\" Tommys are plowing through the streets looking for British and French soldiers. One of them plucks a newspaper from the air and wades its leaflets into the air as they wade towards Dunmirk, where the English and French armies are stationed. A hose is used to lift each side of the soldier\\'s trousers. He grabs his pants and runs away toward a fence twenty yards away', 'Hold the Dark': \"The narrator tells us that we're not alone in this story, because it's all about truth. It's snowing outside. A boy kneels to pack the snow. He's named Bailey and looks up. There's a wolf out there looking for someone. She's totally frozen. On top of that, she's also got yellow eyes. We get another glimpse of one of our favorite characters: Lady Capulet.\", 'Bridget Jones s Baby': \"The action shifts to London and we find a young woman hailing from the bridge. She's Jude, her husband Fergus, and their baby. Bridget joins them and they sit next to her. She looks older than she was when they last saw her. They hug and share a picture of Dinah Cleaver. He's dead. A guy named John walks by and everyone is in a hush.\", 'Dirty Girl': 'A pretty blonde girl sits with her friends at the front lawn. She has three adolescent girls in her car, all of whom are dirty and ugly. One of them is a convertible mustang who rocks around like a bull. Three other boys try to get into the car and drag Davie across the room. He passes a note that Davie has written on it. The note reads: \"Wanna Fauck?\"', 'This Is the End': \"In this short scene, Craig Robinson is on his way to pick up a pastrami at the grocery store. When he gets there, he sees that Willie Mercen has been eating with Jay Barbebel. He looks hurt and smiles. Seth's house isn't crazy, but it's nice. They play Call of Duty together and watch as Dion sings a song about how all things are coming back to Me.\", 'Ryan Hansen Solves Crimes on Television': 'In this short scene, we get a glimpse of our favorite guy, Ryan Handsen, on his way to the top of a hill in the middle of nowhere. He\\'s super bummed about not being able to go for a walk because he\\'s so sweaty. As he walks up the hill, he sees a bunch of crazy women and men walking down the hill with their weird bodies. They\\'re all wearing ridiculously high-pants shorts and holding their phones below them as they shoot \"selfies\" and \"shooting videos\". We also meet a very pretty girl who holds her phone above her face and smiles while holding tea. Then we see that she\\'s wearing an 18th C. Army Officer\\'s uniform.', 'Pacific Rim': 'The narrator gives us some background on the Cosdesdec defense college. It\\'s the main campus left over from the Civil War. There\\'s also a bunch of other stuff going on, including an \"ultimate science division/sci-division\" and an \"almost secret research arm\" of V-50 jumphawk. Also, there\\'s a crewmate for one of these guys named Midway.'}\n"

       " 'Pacific Rim': \"She hears a deafening ROAR and turns to see another memory\\n playing out in the water just off the Pier --\\n Two vast figures clashing in the surf Dread washes over Flick's face as she watches.The shattered windows come back together as the shock wave\\n lifts Young Mako off the floor, and the roar retreats, going\\n back into Trespasser's jaws.Without turning on the lights she drags one out into the\\n middle of the floor and strains to pry open the lid with her\\n bare hands -- she doesn’t know what kind of time she has.Flick packs a suitcase, her eyes still red, her hands still\\n shaking slightly.BACK TO PRESENT\\n The NOISE of the memory echoes as Raleigh pulls himself up to\\n sit on the edge of the bed, his face in his hands.They both chuckle awkwardly as they stare at one another\\n across the hall, a thought on the tip of their tongues,\\n Simultaneously, they realize there's no point in trying to\\n phrase it, and they let themselves collide in the middle of\\n the hallway, kissing hungrily.An AIR RAID SIREN wails and Flick steps back, unconsciously\\n inching away from the blazing heat -- until her last step\\n finds only air, and she falls into the pool of blood.They hold each other, as if waltzing, but without seeing\\n their feet it seems as if the room is spinning around them.Maddened by the noise in his head, Raleigh finally spins to\\n face his brother, finding himself --\\n Young Mako stands at the tall windows, watching Trespasser's\\n rampage.Raleigh glances over his shoulder to take one last look at\\n Mako's door - He thought he heard something.Raleigh's tension starts to ease, but just as a smile of\\n relief begins to creep across his lips, we see something move\\n in the reflection on his helmet --\\n A shape; distorted, out of focus, monstrous, vast...We hear a little girl SOBBING between GASPS of air...\\n Raleigh suddenly finds himself in a dark penthouse, high\\n above a twinkling city.The trees shed pale pink petals, twirling through the air in\\n urgent eddies to envelope the two kissing bodies, blurring\\n with a glow that swells to bleach the whole scene\\n Raleigh opens his eyes, startled awake by the dream.The door splinters open and Newt rushes in to find Flick\\n drenched in sweat and so pale, almost blue.His eyes look past Mako and we hear\\n the drifting voices of his memory.The man breaks the\\n surface and throws his head back, suddenly okay.It seems harmless at first, just a haze of drifting hairs\\n But as they fall closer, they look less and less like hairs,\\n and more like a dense volley of arrows.We don't see their huge payload at first, only the massive\\n shadow it casts over Flick and everything around her as the\\n Jumphawks lift it into position a few blocks away.All eyes turn silently to the blip falling through the\\n Interstice, anxious to see if the last monster has fallen.Raleigh splashes water on his face and meets his reflection\\n in the small mirror, fractured as if by bare knuckles some\\n his cold expression and nods slowly -- Yes, this is\\n His brow cracks and he collapses over the toilet puking up\\n every shred of the stony facade he's been holding, revealing\\n the raw anguish and self-doubt, red-faced and heaving.Raleigh narrows his eyes at\\n the obscured mech Raleigh starts to walk faster, almost jogging across the\\n wide, busy floor to get a clear look at the Jaeger.A great wall of flesh blurs past the pipe, briefly filling\\n the view as the dead kaiju falls off the bluff.Raleigh pulls the ice pack off his eye and Mako finally turns\\n to him, grimly astonished to see the shiner she left him.Her wings beat so fast that they seem to wave very slow, not\\n enough to get the monster off the ground, but enough to make\\n her more nimble than something of her size should be.Some suicidal curiosity tugs Flick towards the opening where\\n she cranes her head out and looks straight up, catching a\\n humbling view of the fight - the impossible scale of it.Newt turns on the lights and we find ourselves --\\n Flick rubs her head and looks up from the floor of the small\\n rail-car as Newt climbs out of his berth.She looks up at him, uncertain, but finally she takes\\n -- just as the ROAR blows out the windows.The Jumphawks circling above shred the monsters with heavy\\n gunfire, just barely getting the last Berserker before it\\n gets within reach of the workers.A deafening BOOM as Puma Real lands a hard blow across the\\n kaiju's skull, throwing up a fine red mist of gore.Stranded atop the Ferris wheel, her searching eyes fall again\\n on that frozen moment out in the still water, Tortuga\\n stabbing the Jaeger, and her desperation mounts.He turns to see Flick, holding a nervous distance of several\\n paces.Mako's eyes shoot open with urgent clarity... and when she\\n It sounds like English to Raleigh too, but he doesn't have\\n time to be astounded.He pulls his hands from his face and sits in the dark,\\n thinking.A vector-straight line of searing light bores clear through\\n the kaiju’s body in an instant to slice across the sky, an\\n oddly bright laser-light show.On the wraparound projection, we see Slattern standing right\\n on top of us, his barbed tail jabbing down like a scorpion\\n until the whole IMAX view flickers to static.She only glances as he sits beside her, quickly turning back\\n to the skyline before her guilt runs away with her.Scunner raises his fists for another strike, but never makes\\n With her one good hand, Tacit Ronin grabs Scunner's throat.Gipsy Danger swings her right arm to SLAM the charging kaiju\\n aside before we get a clear look at it.An older\\n He chuckles and gets a distant look in his eyes as he gazes\\n into the bonfire.She turns back to watch the monster.Their laughter trails, but the thought sticks...\\n Back at Kodiak, most of the teams\\n She turns to face him, propping her chin on her arms.They look deep into each other's eyes as they draw closer.Something stirs beyond the flames; something huge\\n and alive, as if part of the horizon itself was waking up.He hears screaming and quickly spots the\\n back door.They linger atop the floating pod, holding tight to one\\n another, not daring to let go.He grips their shoulders in either hand, and looks between\\n the two of them.They both spot the sign dusted with red earth hanging over\\n the front gate A man waits in the shade of what looks like an old bus stop\\n just outside the entrance to the settlement.Mako lets her head fall\\n back, strangely more frustrated than terrified.suddenly there was a gaping hole\\n smack in the middle of the Pacific,\\n He gets a call one day.The slow music makes\\n it easy, but they keep their eyes on the steps.\"}"
